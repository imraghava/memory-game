// When a card is clicked
$('.card').on('click', function() {


  
  
  
  
});

// Issues that need to be solved:
// 1 - clicking on the same card twice produces a "match"
// 2 - need a better way to add content to cards... I don't want to have 8 if statements if there is a more efficient way to do it
